//! CLI command definitions and handlers
//!
//! This module is organized into submodules for better maintainability:
//! - `commands/io`: File I/O commands (read, write, convert)
//! - `commands/transform`: Data transformation commands (sort, filter, etc.)
//! - `commands/pandas`: Pandas-style operations (head, tail, join, etc.)
//! - `commands/advanced`: Advanced features (validate, chart, batch, etc.)
